# Władysłaium (WŁ) Token Whitepaper

## Abstract
Władysłaium (WŁ) is a novel cryptocurrency built on a unique triangular blockchain structure, offering enhanced security and scalability through geometric consensus mechanisms. This whitepaper presents the technical foundations, tokenomics, and implementation details of the Władysłaium network.

## 1. Introduction
Władysłaium introduces a revolutionary approach to blockchain architecture by utilizing triangular geometric patterns for transaction validation and consensus. This design provides natural sharding capabilities and enables parallel transaction processing while maintaining strong security guarantees.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Triangular Blockchain
The Władysłaium blockchain is structured as a series of interconnected triangular cells, where each cell represents a transaction or block. This geometric approach allows for:
- Natural parallel processing of transactions
- Enhanced scalability through geometric sharding
- Improved validation through multiple parent-child relationships

### 2.2 Consensus Mechanism
The network employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism with geometric validation:
- Miners solve cryptographic puzzles to create new blocks
- Block validity is verified through geometric relationships
- Difficulty adjusts dynamically based on network hash rate
- Current difficulty: 4 (adjustable based on network conditions)

### 2.3 Mining Process
Mining in Władysłaium involves:
- Finding valid nonce values for new blocks
- Maintaining geometric relationships between blocks
- Receiving mining rewards (50 WŁ per block)
- Real-time mining rate monitoring and adjustment

## 3. Tokenomics

### 3.1 Token Distribution
- Initial Supply: 1,000,000 WŁ
- Mining Rewards: 50 WŁ per block
- Maximum Supply: Unlimited (controlled by mining difficulty)

### 3.2 Token Utility
- Transaction fees
- Network governance
- Smart contract execution
- Staking and validation

## 4. Network Architecture

### 4.1 P2P Network
